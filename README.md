# 🏦 Bank Customer Segmentation & 🛡️ Insurance Claim Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project combines two case studies focused on customer behavior and risk prediction:
- **Bank Marketing Data**: Segmentation of customers using clustering techniques.  
- **Insurance Dataset**: Prediction of insurance claims using multiple classification models.

The objective is to derive business insights and predictive patterns to aid in customer targeting and risk assessment.
